## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
  an object with a code block that can be run when called and can be reused over and over again.

- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
  It starts with the function keyword, with an optional name, a comma-separated list of zero or more parameters surrounded by parenthesis, code block inside curly brace with an optional return statement.

- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
  the function name with a parenthesis next to it with an optional zero or more comma-separated list of arguments inside the parenthesis.

- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
  a function definition does not cause the code in code block run, it only runs when it is called.

- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
  when we define a function we declare parameters and when we call a function we pass it arguments.

- Why are function **parameters** useful?
  allows us to pass data into our functions
  parameters act like placeholders whose value are not known until we call the function and pass an argument.

- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
  casues the function to produce a value that we can use and stops the code in code block from running so codes that come after the return statement do not run.
