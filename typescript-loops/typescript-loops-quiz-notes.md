## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is the purpose of a loop?
  It allows you to repeatedly run the same code multiple times

- What is the purpose of a **condition** expression in a loop?
  it let us know if we should continue the loop execution
  the loop only iterates when the condition is met and stops executing when it's not.

- What does "iteration" mean in the context of loops?
  A single execution of the loop body is called an iteration.

- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `while` loop get evaluated?
  before each loop runs

- _When_ does the **initialization** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  once when the loop starts

- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  before each loop iteration

- _When_ does the **final** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  end of each loop iteration, before the next loop starts

- Besides a `return` statement, which exits its entire function block, which keyword exits a loop before its **condition** expression evaluates to `false`?
  break stops the loop, but not the function. return stops the function.

- What does the `++` increment operator do?
  It increases the variable by one and reassigns to the variable

- How do you iterate through the keys of an object?
  for...in loop
